                    Web development involves creating and maintaining websites or web applications. It encompasses various aspects like front-end development focusing on the user interface and user experience, back-end development handling server-side operations and databases, and full-stack development combining both. It includes coding in languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end, and languages like Python, Ruby, or PHP for back-end. Developers use frameworks and tools like React, Angular, Node.js, and Django to streamline the development process. Web development aims to build functional, visually appealing, and responsive websites that cater to user needs while adhering to coding standards and best practices for optimal performance.

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The frontend refers to the user interface and presentation layer of a software application or website that users interact with directly. It encompasses everything users see, interact with, and experience, including layouts, design, buttons, forms, and content. Frontend development involves using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing, intuitive, and responsive interface that communicates effectively with the backend. It focuses on user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design, ensuring seamless interaction, accessibility, and functionality across various devices and browsers for an engaging and user-friendly experience.</p>

            <div class="abc">
                <a href="backend.html"><button><h2>Backend</h2></button></a>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The backend refers to the server-side of software applications, handling data storage, manipulation, and business logic. It comprises databases, server-side scripting, and the application's core logic, unseen by users. It interacts with the frontend, processing requests, managing user authentication, and delivering dynamic content. Backend technologies include server frameworks like Node.js, databases such as MySQL or MongoDB, and server-side languages like Python, Java, or PHP. It ensures data integrity, security, and the overall functionality of an application, enabling communication between the frontend and databases while managing the application's server, ensuring smooth user experiences.</p>
